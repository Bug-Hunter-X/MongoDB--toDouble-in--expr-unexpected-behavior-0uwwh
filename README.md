# MongoDB $toDouble in $expr Unexpected Behavior
This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using the `$toDouble` operator within the `$expr` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The issue involves the inconsistent or incorrect conversion of string values to numbers for comparison.  The provided code snippet and solution highlight the problem and its resolution.

## Problem
The original query utilizes `$toDouble` to convert a price field (stored as a string) to a double for numerical comparison.  However, it does not always accurately convert the string, which leads to incorrect query results.

## Solution
The solution introduces more robust validation and conversion to ensure reliable numerical comparisons.  This could include using explicit schema validation before the query or alternate aggregation techniques to handle data inconsistencies. The provided solution also includes error handling to properly manage and diagnose conversion problems.
